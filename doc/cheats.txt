There is a find-manpage command that can be used to view the manpage for
whatever is under the cursor.  For example, in C, placing the cursor under
the `printf` function call and hitting <Leader>K will invoke the manpage
for printf.

TODO: Figure out how to do documentation look up for C and library calls 
from within Vim.  There has to be a canonical way to do this without needing
fancy plugins.
