There is a find-manpage command that can be used to view the manpage for
whatever is under the cursor.  For example, in C, placing the cursor under
the `printf` function call and hitting <Leader>K will invoke the manpage
for printf.

TODO: Figure out how to do documentation look up for C and library calls 
from within Vim.  There has to be a canonical way to do this without needing
fancy plugins.

Trying to debug a Vim script or understand when a variable was last assigned to?
Give verbose mode a try:

  :verbose set textwidth?

Will let you know when the textwidth variable was changed last.

Things I learned today
- Use `:term` to open an actual terminal running bash
- Window navigation uses `Ctrl-W hjkl`
- 

Wildmenu mode makes command line completion easier

Also, autocomplete is a thing I shoudl use more
- When in insert mode, ^x and so forth
